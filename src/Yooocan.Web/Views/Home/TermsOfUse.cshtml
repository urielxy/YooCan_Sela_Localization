        <br />
        Additionally, Yoocan cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user and encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site and asks that you do not arrange to meet users from the Site in person.
        <br />
        You agree that the Site is a platform operating as a venue and therefore Yoocan is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or third parties on the Site.
